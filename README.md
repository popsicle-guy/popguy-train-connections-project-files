The Godot 3.5 rc5 project files for a game I made for the Kenny Jam 2024

I recommend using either of these specific builds of Godot to open the project as that's what I used
https://github.com/SonicMastr/godot-vita (3.5 rc5 for exporting to Playstation Vita (as .vpk))
https://github.com/Stary2001/godot (3.5.1 for exporting to Nintendo Switch (as .nro))
